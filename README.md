#Play Store Scraper

###Libraries used:
####fuzzy wuzzy
####difflib
####Beautiful Soup
####urllib2

####Also a big shoutout for the iPython notebook community. It makes python so enjoyable :)

Scraping is a bit slow (Google autothrottle :( ) but the results are accurate. The input file needs to be a .txt with app names seperated by commas. eg. 'Angry Birds', 'Cut the Rope'

Also use the iPython notebook file as I've split my logic into individual cells. Also feel free to send me patches and contact me directly at hihari777@gmail.com
